## 1) Equitable Surgeon Workload Allocation Under Uncertainty
**One-liner:** Optimization model to allocate surgical workload fairly while preserving buffer for emergencies.  
**Impact:** Improved equity metrics (envy/imbalance) while maintaining operational feasibility.  
**Methods:** MILP (Gurobi), scenario-based simulation, fairness objectives.  
**Data:** Real-world EHR/OR data (multi-year, surgery-level + surgeon-level).  
**Tools:** Python, Gurobi, R, Jupyter, LaTeX.  
**Links:** *(add later)* Paper / Code / Slides

## 2) Stochastic Simulation of Emergency Surgery Demand + Duration
**One-liner:** Simulation pipeline to generate realistic weekly emergency workload scenarios for optimization testing.  
**Impact:** Stress-tests allocation policies under best-/worst-case emergency loads.  
**Methods:** Distribution fitting, Monte Carlo scenario generation, sensitivity analysis.  
**Data:** Historical emergency cases grouped by workload type + duration.  
**Tools:** Python (`fitter`/`distfit`), R, visualization.  
**Links:** *(add later)* Repo / Technical note

## 3) Aviation Analytics Mini-Project
**One-liner:** Data-driven analysis project using aviation operational data to quantify patterns and support decision-making.  
**Impact:** Clear findings summarized into actionable metrics/visuals.  
**Methods:** Statistical analysis + modeling (briefly name what you did: regression, clustering, forecasting, etc.).  
**Data:** *(what dataset? e.g., flight delays, safety reports, ADS-B, etc.)*  
**Tools:** Python/R, visualization.  
**Links:** *(add later)* Repo / Write-up
